# Mission: Containment — Test Tube Mite Control

## Objective
- **Contain 3 test tubes with mites on them** by flipping the switches next to each tube.

## Steps

1. **Locate the Test Tubes**
   - Find the 3 specific test tubes that are infested with mites.
   - These will be marked or visibly crawling with alien mites.

2. **Flip the Switches**
   - Each test tube has a switch mounted nearby.
   - Approach the test tube and interact with the switch to activate containment.
   - A successful flip will seal the tube and prevent the mites from escaping.

3. **Ensure Complete Containment**
   - All 3 switches must be flipped to complete the objective.
   - Partial containment is not sufficient—mites may escape if not all switches are activated.

## Hazards
- **Berserkers (KETEN, 2500 HP)** may appear during the mission and attempt to disrupt containment.
- Mites may attempt to escape if you delay or are distracted by alien activity.
- Party atmosphere may cause random events or distractions.

## Tips for Success
- Move quickly and methodically between test tubes.
- Be prepared to defend yourself from Berserkers or other disruptions.
- Double-check each switch to ensure it is fully activated.

## Win Condition
- All 3 mite-infested test tubes are securely contained by flipping their respective switches.

## Lose Condition
- Any test tube remains uncontained, or mites escape due to incomplete switching or external interference.
